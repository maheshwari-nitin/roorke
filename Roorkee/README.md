2. Average Directional Index (ADX)  
ADX, or Average Directional Index, is a technical indicator designed to measure the strength of a trend in a financial market. It quantifies the strength of a trend on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a stronger trend. 
3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)  
An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. 
4. Average True Range (ATR)

## Final Presented Strategies
1. Heiken Ashi + ADX  
We eventually chose Heiken Ashi candles and the ADX indicator for swing trading. By using Heiken Ashi candles, we aimed to reduce noise and create a clearer representation of the underlying trend. The ADX indicator was employed to identify the strength of a trend.

3. Heiken Ashi + EMA Short-shell  
In our trading strategy, we used two different approaches for buying and selling. For going long, we used Heiken Ashi candles to reduce noise. A trailing stop loss was implemented based on the Average True Range (ATR) to manage risk and protect positions. We incorporate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a length 5 for executing short trades. Our strategy hinges on identifying instances of market overextension

5. Heiken Ashi + 2 ADX  
The aim was to strike a better balance between identifying meaningful trends and minimizing the impact of noise in the market. We need to filter out the noise present in smaller time frames and thus Heiken Ashi candles and the ADX indicator seems to be driven by the Swing trading on higher time frames
